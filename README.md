# Data-Analysis-on-EarthQuake-occurences
In the project, the activity of the significant earthquakes from the last 50 years is acquired and analyzed. The data collected from the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) around the planet. 
Assumption: An earthquake reaches the category of "Severely Affected" if its magnitude exceeds a grade of 8. 

### Data Exploration
* Mapping all the affected areas
* Number of occurrences of earthquake with different magnitude ranges
* Severity of an earthquake
* Mapping Highly affected areas based on Magnitude
* Correlation between Magnitude vs Depth
* Which month has highest earthquake occurrences?
* Which year has highest earthquake occurrences?

### Prediction
* Performing Linear Regression.
* Explains why Linear Regression is not appropriate for this particular data set.
* Depth and Magnitude are not related linearly
* The dataset has to be predicted through other Non Linear Regression algorithms.
* Matplotlib: Its a plotting library
* Seaborn: Python visualization library
* Basemap: Adds geographical projections. This library is used to plot coast lines, countries.
* We are ignoring the warning such as deprecated.
